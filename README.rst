For Developers
======================

To install the project, fork this repository and clone it to your computer.  Get dependencies
by typing the following two commands::

   sudo apt-get install python-sphinx
   sudo pypi-install sphinx-bootstrap-theme

You may need to install pypi-install in order to run the above commands.  To install pypi-install, type::

   sudo apt-get install python-stdeb

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can render the project by typing::

   make html

You will find the rendered pages in *_build/html*.  A good place to start looking around is *index.html*.
