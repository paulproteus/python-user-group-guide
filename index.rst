A Guide to Running a Python User Group
======================================

This guide is intended to be a simple collection of wisdom learned by
watching, participating in, and helping organize in-person Python
communities over the years. The target audience is anyone who wants to
make their user group better. It focuses on hands-on tips.

If you want to improve it, or you have an idea for new content to add,
or new questions to answer, email me: <asheesh@asheesh.org>!

=========================
Getting people to show up
=========================

Meetup.com or not
=================

*A story*: Two user group organizers were sitting next to each other
at PyCon, sharing stories with a room of people who wanted to discuss
user groups. One was talking about how, nine months earlier, he had
put together a Python user group for his city. He created an email
list, and advertised the group, but never got more than a dozen people
to show up. The one sitting next to him created a group in the very
same city, and quickly saw meetings of 20+ people. Eventually, they
found each other and merged their groups.

*A recommendation*: In this guide, I strongly recommend your group use
Meetup.com. This is despite various reservations: their administration
panel makes it impossible for group organizers to find attendees'
email addresses, and the interface is always changing, to the chagrin
of some users. Meetup.com is a for-pay service, creating an additional
barrier. However, I find user groups are larger, more diverse, and
have more co-organizers if they use Meetup.

Having said that, some user groups seem to do reasonably well with
their own event announcement software. A handful of those, such as
ChiPy in Chicago, also host Meetup.com pages where they cross-announce
their events so they can reach people who use that site.

**Please request reimbursement**. If you do use Meetup.com, the Python
Software Foundation will reimburse you for your yearly Meetup.com
account fees. Just send an email to the PSF requesting that money; see
the :ref:`sample grant application <sample-grants-meetup>` for what to
say when requesting it.

Again, please request this money! The PSF has allocated money toward
this, and wants to spend it on your group! Also, I look good if I am
the one who caused you to get this money.

    General tips on finding attendees
    =================================

=============
Event formats
=============

Lightning talks
===============

Lightning talks are brief talks, usually capped at five minutes, where
someone introduces a topic or tool they care about. This format keeps
the barrier to entry for speaking low, which means that as an
organizer, you can walk around and ask people, one-on-one, "What are
you going to give a lightning talk about?" Ned Batchelder of Boston Python is famous for doing this.

Montreal Python found that by focusing on lightning talks, the core
organizers didn't need to do much publicity for their group. Instead,
they asked the lightning talkers to invite their friends, and the group
grew and grew.

Project night
=============

Project nights are user group meetings where attendees come with their
laptop computers and a desire to work on something
Python-related. These are often the first thing that user groups add
when they want to become more welcoming to newcomers. A true story:
The Boston Python user group was so inclusive and welcoming that it
inspired Boston.rb to run their first project night!

I recommend you choose inclusive phrasing like "project night" rather
than terms like "hack night," since I have seen people feel excluded
by the term "hack."

To make it as great as possible, prepare the following things before
the event:

* Inviting language on your event page to indicate all are welcome,
  whether newcomers, experienced Python programmers, or something
  else.
* A collection of volunteers who are willing to spend the evening answering others' questions.
* A landing page for newcomers with links to tested resources. You can base yours off this page: https://openhatch.org/wiki/Project_night
* A food sponsor, if possible.

Additionally, on the day of the event, when it starts, *set the tone*
by getting everyone's attention and saying:

    Hello, everyone! I'm *name*, organizer of this Python user group.

    Thanks for coming to the project night. We have wifi here, and food
    and drinks that you can take; thanks to *sponsor name* for making
    that possible.

    We're excited about having people of all experience levels in Python
    here today, and to support them, we have a few people who are excited
    about helping beginners. Can I get those people to stand up?

    We've labeled a table as the "Beginner's corner," so if you
    specially want mentorship today, go visit there and say hi to the
    person next to you, and talk with one of the lovely people who
    want to help you have a great time with Python.

    I'll be here all evening, so if you need anything else, just ask me.
    Thanks to all of you for coming!

Setting the tone and helping people understand that they are not just
present, but welcome, can make a huge difference.

Money
=====

What the PSF can provide
========================

Python is supported by a US non-profit, the Python Software
Foundation, and they want to help. That means they will fund a few
things:

* Meetup.com fees (see section on meetup.com)
* Travel for exciting, far-away speakers to visit your town.
* Food and other costs for diversity or newcomer teaching events.
* Food for technical events to improve some part of the Python community (aka sprints).

The PSF can also serve as a "fiscal sponsor" for your user group,
which means you get the benefits of being part of a 501(c)3 US
non-profit without having to do the accounting work for it -- the
PSF's treasurer will do so.

A future version of this document will explain how to get this money.

    NOTE: If you are a group hosted both on Meetup and elsewhere, you
    can also add a sentence like this. "Chicago's main PUG is ChiPy,
    which does not use Meetup, but by creating this account, we can
    mirror ChiPy events to Meetup.com's active userbase."

I am CC:ing Asheesh Laroia, who encouraged me to submit this
application.

Grant size: $144 total

Grant beneficiaries: ChiPy is an active Python user group, with
lightning talks and other meetings monthly.

    NOTE: You should adjust the above text, and then remove this
    "NOTE"! A short sentence is fine; no need to write an essay.
